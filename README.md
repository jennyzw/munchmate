## Munchmate
Mobile app for CS220 that allows for users to meet up and have a meal with someone in their network.

## Instructions Notes
You can treat the app as if it's fully functional with the exception that forms don't actually save anything. This app was designed with front-end, design, and functionality in mind so keep in mind there is no real system in place to find other users or check proximity. The profiles are hard coded in and the message responses are automated pulled from a list. 

## Trouble Shooting
Try to let pages fully load before trying to interact. If something seems frozen, hasn't fully loaded, or the page appears blank when it doesn't seem like it should then just Refresh. If the problem persists then Refresh again. We promise something is there and working! 

##Usage

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Run locally
	
	localhost:8000/checkin.html
